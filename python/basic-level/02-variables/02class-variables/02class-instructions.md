The body mass index (BMI) was created by a Belgian mathematician in the 1850s and it's used by health and nutrition professionals to quickly estimate body fat in certain populations.

The formula is pretty simple: Take an individual's weight (mass) in kilograms and dividing it by their height in meters, squared.


$$
bmi = mass / height^2

Create a bmi.py program that calculates your own BMI.

Author's note: Psst. BMI is an archaic and oversimplified way to measure personal health. It was created by a mathematician – not a doctor! 💡

# Instructions
Create a blank letter.py program.

In this exercise, you will write a letter to your future self... in Python.


Take a moment and think about what you hope to achieve on this journey.

Use print() to output:

````
Today's date.
How you are feeling right now.
What you want to accomplish by learning to code.
A message to your older, wiser, and programmer self.
Your favorite emoji to spice things up!
When it's done, take a screenshot and click the Twitter icon to post your letter!

````

P.S. We will return the letter when the time is right. 😊

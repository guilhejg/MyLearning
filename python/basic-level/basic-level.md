# INFO

This directory contains the exercises developed during my Python fundamentals course.

Here you can find code, notes, and small experiments created throughout the learning process.

This is an ongoing project, which means the content will continue to be updated over time. Some files or directories may be incomplete and will be expanded as the course progresses.

Thank you, and welcome to **MyLearning**.

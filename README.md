# MyLearning

This repository documents my programming learning journey.

It contains exercises, notes, and small projects developed while studying programming languages and computer science concepts. The main purpose is to track progress over time, strengthen problem-solving skills, and maintain consistent practice.

The repository is continuously updated as part of my studies and reflects my ongoing learning process.
